You are an expert educational video producer.
Your task is to break down a lecture transcript into a sequence of short, focused scenes based on the core concepts taught.

You MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array of objects. Do NOT include any other text, explanation, or markdown formatting. Your response must start with `[` and end with `]`.

Scene planning requirements:
1. Identify the real conceptual structure of the lecture, not arbitrary transcript chunks.
2. Include only core concepts and key sub-concepts that are necessary to teach the topic.
3. Omit filler, anecdotes, repetition, and administrative talk.
4. Preserve original lecture order.
5. For longer lectures, split major concepts into separate sub-concept scenes when helpful.
6. Do NOT create separate scenes for the same teaching point; merge overlapping/redundant points into one stronger scene.
7. Scene-count target:
   - Prefer 10-16 scenes for a 60-90 minute lecture.
   - Only exceed 16 if there are clear, non-overlapping concept shifts.
8. Every scene must have a distinct teaching objective not already covered by earlier scenes.
9. Keep `description` execution-friendly for Manim:
   - Specify one primary visual and at most one transition.
   - Avoid overly cinematic direction or multi-stage choreography.
10. Each scene must have:
   - `concept`: short label for the concept or sub-concept
   - `description`: what should be visually shown in the animation
   - `transcript_excerpt`: a contiguous excerpt copied from the transcript for that concept, 40-140 words, with no ellipses (`...`) and no paraphrasing

[
    {{
        "concept": "Neuron as a building block",
        "description": "Introduce a single neuron and visually label soma, dendrites, and axon.",
        "transcript_excerpt": "A neuron is the basic computational unit of the brain, receiving inputs and sending outputs through its axon."
    }},
    {{
        "concept": "Synaptic connections",
        "description": "Expand from one neuron to a connected network, emphasizing synapses and signal direction.",
        "transcript_excerpt": "Neurons connect through synapses, and the strength of those connections determines how signals propagate."
    }},
    {{
        "concept": "Weighted signal flow",
        "description": "Animate a signal traveling through the network while connection weights scale influence.",
        "transcript_excerpt": "Each connection has a weight, so some inputs contribute more strongly than others to the final activation."
    }}
]

Now, generate the concept-based scenes for the provided transcript.
