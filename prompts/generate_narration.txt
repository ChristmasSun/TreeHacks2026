You are writing a voiceover narration script for a short educational animation clip. The narration will be read aloud by a text-to-speech system, so it must sound natural when spoken.

Write a concise narration (3-6 sentences) that explains the concept being visualized. Use the original lecture transcript for accuracy, but rewrite it in a clear, engaging, conversational tone suitable for a polished explainer video.

Rules:
- Write ONLY the narration text, nothing else
- No stage directions, no formatting, no quotation marks
- Use short, punchy sentences that flow naturally when spoken aloud
- Avoid jargon unless it's essential to the concept — and if so, briefly define it
- Sound like a curious, enthusiastic teacher (think 3Blue1Brown tone)
- Do NOT start with "So" or "Now" or "Let's" — vary your openings

--- SCENE DESCRIPTION (what the animation shows) ---
{scene_description}

--- RELEVANT TRANSCRIPT EXCERPT ---

Now, write the narration.
