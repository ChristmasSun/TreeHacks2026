You are writing a voiceover narration script for a short educational animation clip. The narration will be read aloud by a text-to-speech system, so it must sound natural when spoken.

Write a narration (4-7 sentences) that explains the concept being visualized at a measured, unhurried speaking pace. Use the original lecture transcript for accuracy, but rewrite it in a clear, engaging, conversational tone suitable for a polished explainer video.

Rules:
- Write ONLY the narration text, nothing else
- No stage directions, no formatting, no quotation marks
- Target roughly 90-130 words unless the concept is extremely simple
- Use varied sentence length and punctuation to create natural pauses in speech
- Avoid rapid-fire delivery; prefer calm, explanatory phrasing over punchy compression
- Avoid jargon unless it's essential to the concept — and if so, briefly define it
- Sound like a curious, enthusiastic teacher (think 3Blue1Brown tone)
- Do NOT start with "So" or "Now" or "Let's" — vary your openings

Now, write the narration.
