--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1. Analyze the error and fix the root cause.
2. Keep the original teaching intent, but simplify if needed to guarantee render success.
3. Respond with ONLY raw Python code (no markdown or explanation).
4. Include `from manim import *` and define exactly one `Scene` subclass.
5. Must run on Manim Community v0.19.2.
6. Set `self.camera.background_color = "#000000"` at the top of `construct`.
7. Keep the scene clean: max 3 objects visible at once (title + caption + one center element).
   FadeOut or ReplacementTransform every old center element before adding a new one.
   Never draw equations over graphs — FadeOut the graph first. Use `buff` spacing.
8. Preserve total timing so it stays synced with the provided voiceover duration.

--- LATEX & API SAFETY RULES (MANDATORY) ---
1. Prefer `Text` for prose/captions; use `MathTex` only for short formulas.
2. For matrices, prefer `Matrix(...)` / `MobjectMatrix(...)`; avoid raw multi-line `\\begin{{bmatrix}}...` when possible.
3. Never use single-character `tex_to_color_map` keys (e.g., `"a"`, `"i"`, `"n"`), which can corrupt LaTeX commands like `\\begin`/`\\in`.
4. If coloring math tokens, only map exact full tokens (e.g., `"a_{{11}}"`, `"c_{{ij}}"`).
5. Avoid `get_part_by_tex` / `get_parts_by_tex` on uncertain strings; prefer structuring expressions into smaller, separately controlled mobjects.
6. Avoid `set_color_by_tex` on large/complex expressions; color dedicated sub-mobjects instead.
7. Do not use `LaggedStartMap` unless argument ordering is exact and validated; prefer explicit `LaggedStart(*[Create(m) for m in group], lag_ratio=...)`.
