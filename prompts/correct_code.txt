--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
1.  Analyze the error. Fix the root cause, not just the symptom.
2.  If the approach is fundamentally broken, simplify — use a different technique that achieves the same visual intent.
3.  Respond with ONLY raw Python code. No markdown, no explanation.
4.  Include `from manim import *`. Define a single Scene class.
5.  Must work with Manim Community v0.18.1.
6.  Set `self.camera.background_color = "#000000"` at top of `construct`.
7.  Keep the scene clean: max 2-3 text blocks at once, `FadeOut` old elements, use `buff` for spacing.
8.  Maintain the same total animation duration to stay synced with the voiceover.
